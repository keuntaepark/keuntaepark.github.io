👋 Hi, I'm Keuntae Park

🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Advertising/Public Relations from Hongik University (2019) and am currently pursuing a Master's in Business/Data Analytics (MSBA).

🌇 Born and raised in Seoul City, I am passionate about applying mathematical and statistical models to hands-on business strategies.

📚 In a previous role as a content marketer, I enhanced the usability and competitiveness of brand content. This included optimizing an online exhibition showroom for a leading electronics brand's HVAC division. Utilizing Google Analytics and Unity Analytics, I implemented UI enhancements and fine-tuned page loading speed, achieving a 300% surge in daily user growth and a substantial increase in sales.

💻 At CHANEL, I served as a Media Coordinator where I collaborated across teams and leveraged tools like Brand Watch and Google Analytics to tailor media strategies for specific consumer segments.

🏔 Outside of work, I find peace and rejuvenation through practicing yoga and enjoying nature runs.

💪 My specialty is translating data-driven marketing insights into actionable strategies and facilitating seamless collaboration among cross-functional teams.
