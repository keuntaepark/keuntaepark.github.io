👋🏽 Hello, my name is Keuntae Park.

🎓 Preparing to be grad with a M.S. in Data Science at ABC University. (May 2022)

🌇 New York City Native, with a passion for developing and applying mathematical and statistical models to hands-on strategies that will grow business.

📚 Previously content marketer, my primary objective was to enhance the usability and competitiveness of an online exhibition showroom for a well-known electronics brand's HVAC division. Through data analysis using GA, UI enhancements, and streamlining page loading speed, I accomplished a remarkable 300% surge in daily user growth and expanded sales.

In my recent position as a media coordinator at CHANEL, my main responsibility was to drive campaign success through the strategic use of media data analysis.

💻 I aspire to leverage decision science techniques in marketing and product development to create remarkable customer experiences and forge meaningful brand connections. By harnessing data-driven insights, I aim to drive strategic decision-making and leave a lasting impact on the customer journey.

🏔In my free time, I find peace and rejuvenation by immersing myself in the practice of yoga and embracing the invigorating runs surrounded by the nature.
