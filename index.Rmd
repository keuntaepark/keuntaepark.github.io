👋🏽 Hi, it is Keuntae Park.

🎓 Bachelor's degree in Advertising/Public Relations, Hongik University (2019)
   Pursuing Master's in Business/Data Analytics (MSBA)

🌇 New York City Native, with a passion for developing and applying mathematical and statistical models to hands-on strategies that will grow business.

📚 Previously as content marketer, my primary objective was to enhance the usability and competitiveness of an online exhibition showroom for a well-known electronics brand's HVAC division. Through data analysis using GA, UI enhancements, and streamlining page loading speed, I accomplished a remarkable 300% surge in daily user growth and expanded sales.

In my recent position as a media coordinator at CHANEL, my main responsibility was to drive campaign success through the strategic use of media data analysis.

💻 I aim to blend decision science, data insights, and meticulous attention to detail to curate a thoughtful, warm customer experience. Through fostering meaningful brand connections, strategic decision-making, and leaving a lasting impact, I cultivate genuine customer engagement.

🏔 In my free time, I find peace and rejuvenation by immersing myself in the practice of yoga and embracing the invigorating runs surrounded by the nature.
